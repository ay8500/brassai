Classmates Homepage

This is a home page solution for classmates. The main goal is to bring the old classmates together.
Therefore, the visitor of this PHP-based website has the possibility to create a user account and associate it with the class he attended as a student.

Former teachers and students form a valuable database for people tracing. The world map shows the distribution of students after high school.

This website can be used to organize classmate meetings.

An important part of the software is the photo album. People can be tagged here.

Deceased persons have an "obituary page" here candles can be lit but bouquets of flowers can also be deposited.

Most data can be changed as an anonymous user. These changes are stored in the background until the site administrator approves them.

The data is stored in a MariaDB. The software does not use any third-party PHP frameworks. Data access classes, logging classes and unit tests are part of this software.

The site is GDPR compliant. If desired, a full report can be created for each person on their data. The deletion of individual or complete data can be requested at any time.
